# Fun Ideas

This directory contains experimental ideas that fun may or may not implement. It
is not distributed via jsr or deno.land/x but can be referenced directly via
github branches. Occasionally, an idea will be moved into the root directory
with an @experimental tag in the module documentation. These modules are not api
stable and may change from time to time until stabilized.

If you wish to add a new module to fun it's best to open a pull request with the
module in this directory so that merging it doesn't impact production use.
